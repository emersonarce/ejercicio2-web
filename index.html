                <p>I had a great weekend. On Friday afternoon, I finished work at 5 PM. I went home and took a shower. Then I went to see a couple of my friends at a bar downtown. 

                    We had a couple of beers and a nice talk. 
                    
                    Tom told us about his new job, and Jim told us about his new girlfriend. After a while, we went to a restaurant and had pizza. I went to bed late that night, but I was very happy.
                    
                    On Saturday morning I went running in the park. I ran 5 kilometers, and then came home.
                    
                    After that, I met my girlfriend for lunch. We went to a Thai restaurant near my house. I love Thai food!
                    
                    I spent the evening with my girlfriend, watching TV on the sofa.
                    
                    The next day, I got up and caught the train to my parents’ town. I usually go to see my parents on Sundays, at least twice a month.
                    
                    My mom usually makes a roast, and we go for a walk in the park or in the country after lunch.
                    
                    This weekend was a bit different, though. My parents took me out for a nice lunch, because it was my birthday. After lunch, we took a walk (as usual) and then I caught the train back to London.
                    
                    Now it’s Monday and I’m back at work, but I’ve got big plans for next weekend! <br><br>

                    De momento, seguimos con otro texto sobre la familia… Shawn’s family is not very big.

                    His mother and father live in a flat in London. His father works in an insurance company, and his mother is a nurse. She works for the National Health Service.
                    
                    Shawn shares a flat with two friends and works in a restaurant. He’s a waiter. He has two sisters, Lucy and Millie, who live together in Southampton.
                    
                    Shawn has a girlfriend, and Lucy has a boyfriend, but Millie is single.
                    
                    Shawn’s girlfriend’s name is Maria, and she’s Italian. She moved to the UK to study English a few years ago, and then stayed. She works in a café near Piccadilly Circus.
                    
                    Shawn’s in love with Maria, and he also really likes her dog. He loves going for long walks in the park with Maria and her dog.
                    
                    Since they’ve been going out for over a year, Shawn’s thinking of asking Maria to move in with him. Rent prices are high in London, and they could save a lot of money by living together.</p>
